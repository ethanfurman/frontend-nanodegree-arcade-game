How to Load
===========

Once you have installed the files on your computer, open your favorit web
browser, navigate to the folder where you installed the files, and open
`index.html`.


How to Play
===========

The goal of the game is to get your character to the water without touching
(or getting touched by) any bugs.

The arrow keys will move you left, right, up, and down.

Every time you succeed the bugs will get a little faster, and occasionally
another bug will be added.
